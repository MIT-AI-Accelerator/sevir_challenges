# Radar Nowcast Challenge

The radar nowcast challenge is to generate future radar imagery given previous radar and satellite imagery as input.


This challenge is still in development.  See [RadarNowcastChallenge notebook](https://github.com/markveillette/sevir_challenges/blob/main/radar_nowcasting/RadarNowcastBenchmarks.ipynb) for a description of the datasets, problem, baseline model, and metrics.
