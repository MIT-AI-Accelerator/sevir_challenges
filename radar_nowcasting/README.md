# Radar Nowcast Challenge

The radar nowcast challenge is to generate future radar imagery given previous radar and satellite imagery as input.

See [RadarNowcastChallenge notebook](RadarNowcastBenchmarks.ipynb) for a description of the datasets, problem, baseline model, and metrics.

Solutions can be tracked using the SEVIR challenge leaderboard on [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/weather-forecasting-on-sevir).
